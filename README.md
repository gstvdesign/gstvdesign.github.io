# Instituto Benefi

Thatâ€™s a website for a webdesign agency that works for education companys who cares about the future of their students based on Brazil.

### Tools we used

The first version of this website was made using: 

1. [Jekyll](http://http://jekyllrb.com/)
2. [Materializecss](http://materializecss.com/)

Soon there will a second version of it, probably with other tools.
